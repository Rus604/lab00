## Lab 0: Introduction to Version Control and GitHub

This lab introduces the student to a common distributed version control system (`git`) and a central repository for hosting our work (GitHub). This "zeroth" lab is an ungraded lab and simply gets students set up for future work in the course.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, students should have

* a basic understanding of distributed version control systems
* created a GitHub account for free with unlimited private repositories
* joined the CSC131 organization on GitHub
* signed into Slack and introduced themselves to the class
